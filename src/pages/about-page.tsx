            I am currently a graduate student in Georgia Tech’s Online Master’s
            program. I previously completed my Bachelor’s in computer science at
            Brown University. My areas of interest include computing systems,
            cybersecurity, and UI/UX.

            I also love art, music, video games, and staying active. I play
            classical piano, draw, paint, and rock climb in my free time. This
            website serves as a public place for me to collect a record of my
            experience and interests over the years!
